# LncCat
Background: Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is one of the important types of transcripts, which plays essential regulatory roles in cancers and disease developments without protein-coding ability. Next-generation sequencing technology has generated numerous transcripts. Discovery and identification of new lncRNAs is a fundamental step for research on mechanisms of cancer. Small ORFs (sORFs) were once thought to have a lower capacity to translate proteins. However, recent studies have shown that sORFs can also encode peptides. Therefore, identifying lncRNA with sORFs can contribute to discovering more novel regulation factors.
Results: In this paper, we propose a model called LncCat based on category boosting (CatBoost) and ORF-attention features to identify lncRNA. LncCat integrates five types of information to encode transcript sequences and utilizes CatBoost to construct a prediction model. Furthermore, the comparison of visualization reflects that lncRNAs and protein-coding transcripts are significantly different in ORF-attention features. The results show that LncCat achieves significant improvements on several benchmark datasets. The Matthewâ€™s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of LncCat achieves 0.9503, 0.9219, 0.8591, 0.8672 and 0.9047 on the human, mouse, zebrafish, wheat and chicken datasets, respectively, which improves by 1.90%~7.82%, 1.49%~17.63%, 6.11%~21.50%, 3.02%~51.64% and 5.35%~26.90%, respectively. Moreover, LncCat dramatically improves the MCC by at least 6.88%, 22.98% and 39.43% on sORFs test datasets of human, mouse and zebrafish, respectively.
Conclusions: Based on the comparing results, LncCat shows higher performance on multiple long ORF and small ORF datasets. by enhancing ORF-related features. Moreover, a user-friendly web server is developed for academics at http://cczubio.top/lnccat/.
